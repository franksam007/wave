[Wave v0.15 is out](https://github.com/h2oai/wave/releases/tag/v0.15.0). This release ships with **[WaveDB](https://wave.h2o.ai/docs/wavedb)**, a lightweight companion database to Wave, based on SQLite. 

<!--truncate-->

**WaveDB** is [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) with a HTTP interface.

It is a ~6MB (~2MB [UPX](https://upx.github.io/)-compressed) self-contained, zero-dependency executable that bundles SQLite 3.35.5 (2021-04-19) with JSON1, RTREE, FTS5, GEOPOLY, STAT4, and SOUNDEX.

If you are already a fan of SQLite, WaveDB acts as a thin HTTP-server wrapper that lets you access your SQLite databases over a network.

WaveDB can be used as a lightweight, cross-platform, installation-free companion SQL database for Wave apps. The `h2o-wave` package includes non-blocking `async` functions to access WaveDB.
